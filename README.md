```Goodies: 2022 Hactoberfest Tshirts```


## How can a beginner participate?
1. Technical contributions
2. Non technical contributoins

> For    `` Non technical contributions ``, they are saying that you could make contributions to documentation for some projects. But this also needs some level of effort. When I heard about Hacktoberfest, I just registered and leave it there without doing any contributions. But then I go through the list projects I find out some too easy projects to contribute to. So I`m listing here four Github repositories anyone can contribute to, it’s too easy, you just need to add your Github profile name etc in their readme file. Some of them have instructions on how to contribute. So let’s do it.
1. Register or login to github.com
2. Register to Hacktoberfest.
3. Contribute to [these](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest2022-accepted) repositories or any others repositories you like, check instructions to contribute in each repositories.

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes is common, but never give up keep trying
4. Check your progress from [here](https://hacktoberfestchecker.jenko.me/).
5. Post successful submission of 4 PR and accepted by respective projet owners , and Digital ocean conisiders it as valid contributions, Digital ocean will ask for shipping address via email to send you the goodies.
6. Wait for that awesome Hacktoberfest t-shirt from Github & Digital Ocean.

Finally Happy Hactoberfest Day :)
