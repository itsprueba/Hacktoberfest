GAME

Modify the program so that the exits is a dictionary rather than a list,
with the keys being the numbers of the locations and the values being
dictionaries holding the exits (as they do at present). No change should
be needed to the actual code.

Once that is working, create another dictionary that contains words that
players may use. These words will be the keys, and their values will be
a single letter that the program can use to determine which way to go.

Challenge time!

We have mentioned that the data for the Adventure game could be organised in many
different ways.  We've created another way for you.
Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to
change the code to make it work.
Below is the the complete program from the last video, but with the
locations dictionary modified so that everything is in a single dictionary.
N.B. Yes the code has some errors, thats what you need to fix!
